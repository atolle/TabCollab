        <h2>Why can't I see the <i class="fa fa-play fa"></i> button on the Tab page for my tab versions?</h2>
        <p>
            The Player (powered by alphaTab&trade;) only supports Guitar Pro files (.gp3, .gp4, .gp5, .gpx).

        <h2>How do I see my notifications?</h2>
        <p>
            Look for the <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color: gray;"></i> icon at the top of the page. It will turn green <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color: rgb(134, 192, 144);"></i> when you have notifications.

        <h2>How do I find my bandmates on TabCollab?</h2>
        <p>
            Search for their username in the search bar at the top of the page. Once you find them, select Add Friend. They'll get the request and once they accept, you can add them as a contributor to projects or vice versa.

        <h2>I added a new tab to my bandmate's project, but I don't see it counted in my overall tab version count. Why?</h2>
        <p>
            Tab versions are owned by the owner of the project. This means that if you add a new tab or tab version to your bandmate's project, it is attached to their account and not yours. Likewise, any tabs or tab versions added by your bandmates to your own projects are attached to your account.

        <h2>How do I allow my bandmates to contribute to my projects?</h2>
        <p>
            You can add bandmates to your projects from the project edit screen once you are friends. Look for the <i class="fa fa-pencil fa"></i> button beneath each project on the projects page, or the Edit Project button on the Tabs page. Select the desired user from the Contributors drop down and select Save. Once you add them, they'll see your projects under the Their Projects tab on the Tab page.

        <h2>How do I remove contributors from my projects?</h2>
        <p>
            You can remove contributors from your projects from the project edit screen. Look for the <i class="fa fa-pencil fa"></i> button beneath each project on the projects page, or the Edit Project button on the Tabs page. Select the <i class="fa fa-times fa"></i> next to the user and select Save. They'll no longer have access to the project.
